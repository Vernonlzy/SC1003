# SC1003 - Introduction to Computational Thinking & Programming Assignment

This is the solution to the assignment!

**Course Aims**/b
Computational thinking (CT) is the process of analysing a problem then designing and
expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes
a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered
steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively
implemented as programs running on computer.  
The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a
computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the
programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. Student will also learn
about basic program construct and simple data structures. In addition, the course will
include topics to appreciate the internal operations of a processor.
